What’s New in ASP.NET MVC 4?
	This book explores the ASP.NET "MVC" Framework in depth, showing-taking how to make the most of the  features and functionality it offers.	Since we’re now up to the fourth version of the framework, however, much of what the  book covers is functionality that existed prior to this latest version. If you are already familiar with previous versions of the framework, you’re probably eager to  skip over what you already know and begin learning all about the new additions.
The list below gives a brief description of each of the features new to version 4 of ASP.NET MVC. Along with references pointing you to the sections of the book that show these features in action?
Asynchronous controllers.
	Internet Information Server (IIS) processes each request it receives on a new thread, so each new request ties up one of the finite number of threads available to IIS, even if that thread is sitting idle (for example, waiting for a response from a database query or web service).	And, while recent updates in .NET Framework 4.0 and IIS 7 have drastically increased the default number of threads available to the IIS thread pool, it’s still a good practice to avoid holding on to  system resources for longer than you need to.
	Version 4 of the ASP.NET MVC Framework introduces asynchronous controllers to better handle these types of long-running requests in a more asynchronous fashion. Through the use of asynchronous controllers, you can tell the framework to free up the thread that is processing your request. And letting it perform other processing tasks while it waits for the various tasks in the request to finish. Once they finish,  the framework picks up where it left off, and returns the same response as if the request had gone through a normal synchronous controller—except now you can handle many more requests at once?! If you’re interested in learning more about asynchronous controllers, see Chapter 11, which explains them in depth...
